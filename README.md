# 100

Trying to decide between two different courses offered by Paul Hudson on his site, [Hacking With Swift](https://hackingwithswift.com/). Both are 100 days in duration, both are about Apple's Swift programming language, but one is about "Swift" whereas the other is about "SwiftUI". 

Since I've been plucking away at Swift lately, I'll probably dive into the older, "100 Days of Swift" first, then branch over to the SwiftUI part after I've developed a basic understanding of the former.
